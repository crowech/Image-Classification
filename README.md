# Image-Classification
Hands on practice with CNNs by preforming an image classification task

The purpose of this report is to learn how to implement and interpret Convolutional Neural Networks. 
Throughout this report, I will be trying to correctly classify images. There are 6,000 images from three 
different classes, Strawberries, Cherries and Tomatoes 2,000 from each class. To complete the image 
classification, I followed a TensorFlow tutorial coding in Python.
